TCP three-way-handshake
1st packet: Sending Host: A  [SYN]      seq = 0
2nd packet: Sending Host: B  [SYN, ACK] seq = 0 ack = 1
3rd packet: Sending Host: A  [ACK]      seq = 1 ack = 1
Explanation: Syn bit set means to synchronyse sequence numbers
Ack bit set means its acknowloging a message that was recieved.
min(cwnd, rcwd) - bits currently in transit = bytes a sender can still send over the link.
min(cwnd, rcwd) - (highestSeq#SentSoFar - largestAckRecievedSoFar) = bytes that can still be sent.

IP Network Addressing
netmask: 1 bits are reserved, 0 bits indicate available bits for the subnet to assign hosts with.  For example: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 or 255.255.255.0  means that there are 8 bits available to represent different hosts. In this example they can represent 255 unique addresses.
Broadcast address: make all host bits 1's. in this example it would be 255.255.255.255 (If one of the fields was originally a smaller number, say 248, and we only had 1 host bit to manipulate. then the broadcast for that byte would be 249 i.e 255.255.255.249)

bandwidth = bits/sec | round trip = there and back | packet size, can be MSS for window sizes. 
one packet = one window.


CSMA/CD : Carier sense multiple access collision avoidence. 
RTS: request to send 
CTS: clear to send

Process:
1. If channel sensed Idle, transmitts frame after short period of time known as the Distributed Inter-frame Space. 
2. Otherwise random backoff time is chosen (binary exponential backoff) which only decreases while there is a idle channel.  Timer remains frozen during a busy channel.
3. When the timer reaches zero, station transmitts entire frame and waits for ack.
4. If ack recived then it goes to step two.  If no ack then step two is repeated with a larger backoff.






What is  exponential moving average?
